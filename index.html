            <P class="card-text"><i>Did you know that the Akan people are believed to have migrated to their current location from the Sahara desert and Sahel regions of Africa into the forest region around the 11th century. Many Akans told their history as it started in the eastern region of Africa as this is where the ethnogenesis of the Akan as we know them today happened.The Akans consider themselves one nation. Akan means first, foremost, indicating the enlightened and civilized. While
                traditionally matrilineal, they are also united philosophically through 12 patrilineal spirit groups called the Ntoro or
                egya-bosom. Within the Akan nation are branches based on many dialects, widest (and possibly the oldest) one used is
                Twi. Each branch subsequently holds a collection of states and stemming from city-states. The state or Aman is typically
                ruled by several kings known as Ahemfo. The state is the basic unit of Akan polity. Several states and city-states can
                band together to form a confederacy or an empire regardless of clan or abusua they belong to, while those outsides of
                the Akan tribe or the abusua were usually conquered or annexed via war or mutual agreement. For example, the Guan state
                of Larteh and the Akyem state of Akropong joined together to form the Akwapim Kingdom to avoid the Akwamu, who the Guan
                deemed as oppressive. Under the State there are Divisions and under these Divisions are towns and villages.[21]
